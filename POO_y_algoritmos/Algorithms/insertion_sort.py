    Algorithm
    To sort an array of size n in ascending order:

        1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array.

        2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.

        3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor,
        compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements
        one position up to make space for the swapped element.
